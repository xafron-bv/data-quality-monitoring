# Repository Reorganization Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Identified True Entrypoints
Entrypoints are modules that are not imported by any other module. The following were identified:
- `multi_sample_evaluation.py`
- `analyze_column.py`
- `generate_detection_weights.py`
- `llm_model_training.py`
- `ml_index.py`

Note: `anomaly_injection.py` was initially considered but is actually imported by other modules, so it remains in `anomaly_detectors/`.

### 2. Kept Entrypoints in Root
All entrypoint scripts remain in the project root for easy access and execution.

### 3. Moved Shared Dependencies to `common/`
Created a `common/` directory containing all shared modules:
- `brand_config.py`
- `common_interfaces.py`
- `comprehensive_detector.py`
- `consolidated_reporter.py`
- `debug_config.py`
- `error_injection.py`
- `evaluator.py`
- `exceptions.py`
- `field_column_map.py`
- `field_mapper.py`
- `ml_curve_generator.py`
- `unified_detection_interface.py`
- `comprehensive_sample_generator.py`
- `confusion_matrix_analyzer.py`

### 4. Created Report Structure
Each entrypoint now has a dedicated report structure:
- `{entrypoint_name}/reports/` - Directory for all generated reports
- `{entrypoint_name}/reports/viewer.html` - HTML viewer for browsing reports

### 5. Updated Imports
- All imports were updated to reflect the new structure
- Common modules use relative imports within the `common/` package
- External modules import from `common.module_name`
- Fixed import paths in all affected files

### 6. Updated Output Paths
Each entrypoint now outputs to its own reports directory by default:
- `multi_sample_evaluation.py` → `multi_sample_evaluation/reports/`
- `analyze_column.py` → `analyze_column/reports/`
- `generate_detection_weights.py` → `generate_detection_weights/reports/`
- `llm_model_training.py` → `llm_model_training/reports/`
- `ml_index.py` → `ml_index/reports/`

### 7. Updated .gitignore
Added all report directories to `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean:
```
multi_sample_evaluation/reports/
analyze_column/reports/
generate_detection_weights/reports/
llm_model_training/reports/
ml_index/reports/
```

### 8. Updated Documentation
- Updated `README.md` with a new "Project Structure" section
- Completely rewrote `ENTRY_POINTS_README.md` to reflect the new organization
- Created this summary document

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Entrypoints, shared dependencies, and domain-specific modules are clearly separated
2. **Easy Execution**: Entrypoints remain in root for simple command-line access
3. **Clean Repository**: Report directories are git-ignored
4. **Organized Reports**: Each entrypoint has its own report space with a viewer
5. **Maintainable**: The structure makes it easy to identify dependencies and relationships

## Migration Notes

For existing users:
- Entrypoint scripts are still in the root directory
- Output will now go to dedicated report directories
- Update any scripts that expect output in old locations
- The `common/` module structure may require import updates in custom scripts
