# Introduction and Overview

## What is the Data Quality Detection System?

The Data Quality Detection System is a comprehensive, multi-method data quality monitoring solution for detecting errors and anomalies in structured data. Originally designed for fashion/retail product catalogs, the system is field-agnostic and brand-independent, making it adaptable to various data domains.

## Key Features

- üéØ **Multi-Method Detection**: Combines rule-based validation, pattern matching, machine learning, and language models
- üìä **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Built-in metrics, confusion matrix analysis, and performance tracking
- üîß **Highly Configurable**: Customizable field mappings, detection thresholds, and brand configurations
- üíæ **Memory Efficient**: Sequential processing, model caching, and optimized resource usage
- üìà **Performance Optimized**: Weighted combination based on historical performance data
- üåê **Brand Agnostic**: Supports multiple brands through configuration files
- üì± **Visual Interface**: Interactive HTML5 viewer for result exploration

## Detection Methods Overview

The system employs four complementary detection approaches, each with different confidence levels and use cases:

### 1. Validation (Rule-Based)
- **Confidence**: 100% (deterministic)
- **Purpose**: High-confidence error detection using business rules
- **Best for**: Known patterns, format violations, business rule compliance
- **Speed**: Very fast

### 2. Pattern-Based Anomaly Detection
- **Confidence**: 70-80% (configurable)
- **Purpose**: Medium-confidence detection using statistical patterns
- **Best for**: Outliers, unusual patterns, format deviations
- **Speed**: Fast

### 3. ML-Based Detection
- **Confidence**: Configurable (typically 70-85%)
- **Purpose**: Semantic similarity analysis using sentence transformers
- **Best for**: Contextual anomalies, semantic inconsistencies
- **Speed**: Medium (GPU accelerated)

### 4. LLM-Based Detection
- **Confidence**: Configurable (typically 60-80%)
- **Purpose**: Advanced semantic understanding with language models
- **Best for**: Complex semantic errors, contextual understanding
- **Speed**: Slower (GPU accelerated)

## System Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular, layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## Design Principles

### 1. Modularity
Each detection method is self-contained and implements common interfaces, allowing new methods to be added without modifying existing code.

### 2. Extensibility
The system is designed to be easily extended with new fields, detection methods, and output formats through configuration and plugins.

### 3. Performance
Sequential processing, model caching, and GPU acceleration ensure efficient resource usage even with large datasets.

### 4. Flexibility
Configurable thresholds, weights, and field mappings allow the system to adapt to different domains and use cases.
