## üîç Common Tasks

### "I want to..."

**Run a quick test**
‚Üí Start with [Quick Start Tutorial](quick-start.md)

**Process my company's data**
‚Üí Read [Configuration Reference](../reference/configuration.md) to set up brand mapping

**Improve detection accuracy**
‚Üí Follow [Performance Optimization](../user-guides/optimization.md)

**Add a new field type**
‚Üí Study [Adding Fields](../development/adding-fields.md)
