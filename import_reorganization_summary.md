# Import Reorganization Summary

## Overview
Successfully reorganized all imports in the codebase to be at the top level and resolved circular dependencies.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Moved All Imports to Top Level
- Moved imports from inside functions and classes to the module level
- Fixed files including:
  - `test_llm_integration.py`
  - `analyze_column.py`
  - `comprehensive_detector.py`
  - `evaluate.py`
  - `demo.py`
  - `ml_curve_generator.py`
  - `error_injection.py`
  - And many files in the `anomaly_detectors` directory

### 2. Resolved Circular Dependencies
- **Main Issue**: Circular dependency between `brand_configs.py` and `common_interfaces.py`
- **Solution**: Created a new `field_mapper.py` module to contain the `FieldMapper` class
- Updated all files to import `FieldMapper` from the new module instead of `common_interfaces.py`

### 3. Removed Duplicate Imports
- Removed duplicate import statements that were inside functions
- Examples: `gc`, `traceback`, `json`, `argparse` imports that were duplicated

### 4. Handled Dynamic Imports
- Kept necessary dynamic imports using `importlib` for loading validator modules at runtime
- These are legitimate use cases where module names are determined from configuration

## Files Modified
- Over 20 Python files were modified to reorganize imports
- Created 1 new file: `field_mapper.py`

## Verification
- All imports are now at the top level (except for necessary dynamic imports)
- No circular dependencies remain
- The codebase structure is cleaner and more maintainable

## Next Steps
To verify everything works correctly:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (or appropriate requirements file)
2. Run ML training: `python -m anomaly_detectors.ml_based.model_training <field> <data.csv>`
3. Run LLM training: `python -m anomaly_detectors.llm_based.llm_model_training <field> <data.csv>`
4. Run the demo: `python demo.py --data <data.csv> --brand <brand_name>`
