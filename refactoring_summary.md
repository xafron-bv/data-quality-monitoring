# Refactoring Summary: Script Reorganization

## Changes Made

### 1. Script Renaming
- **`evaluate_main.py` → `multi_sample_evaluation.py`**
  - Removed single-sample functionality
  - Now focused exclusively on multi-sample statistical evaluation
  - Evaluates a single field across multiple samples for statistical performance analysis

- **`demo.py` → `single_sample_multi_field_demo.py`**
  - Better describes its purpose: runs detectors/validators on a single sample across multiple fields
  - No functionality changes, just renamed for clarity

- **`test_llm_integration.py` → DELETED**
  - Removed as requested
  - Was a test script for LLM integration

### 2. Functionality Changes

#### `multi_sample_evaluation.py`
- Removed the `--evaluation-mode` argument (no longer supports single-sample mode)
- Removed the `--injection-intensity` and `--max-issues-per-row` arguments (single-sample specific)
- Removed the `run_comprehensive_evaluation()` function
- Removed imports for comprehensive sample generation and consolidated reporting
- Updated help text and documentation to reflect its focused purpose

#### `single_sample_multi_field_demo.py`
- No functionality changes
- Updated internal help text to use the new script name

### 3. Documentation Updates
Updated all references to the old script names in:
- `README.md`
- `run_evaluations.sh`
- `test_plan.md`
- `import_reorganization_summary.md`
- `docs/demo_commands.md`
- `docs/WEIGHTED_COMBINATION.md`
- `docs/CLASS_HIERARCHY_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- `anomaly_detectors/llm_based/README.md`

### 4. Usage Summary

**For Multi-Sample Statistical Evaluation (single field, multiple samples):**
```bash
python multi_sample_evaluation.py data/source.csv --field material --output-dir results/material_test
```

**For Single-Sample Multi-Field Demo (single sample, multiple fields):**
```bash
python single_sample_multi_field_demo.py --brand your_brand --injection-intensity 0.15
```

This refactoring makes the purpose of each script clearer and removes redundant functionality.
